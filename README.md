# How to use dependency injection in .NET Azure Functions 

This repository contains several branches which can be used to illustrate what needs to be refactored in order to use dependency injection in a .NET Core Azure Functions project.

This repository is used at a live webinar during [Xebia Webinar Week](https://pages.xebia.com/academy-webinar-week/dependency-injection-in-net-azure-functions).

Don't look at this master branch. Look at these branches instead:

| [development-v2](https://github.com/marcduiker/xebia-webinar-week-azurefunctions/tree/development-v2) | .NET Core 2 / Azure Functions 2 | Yes
| [development-v3-start](https://github.com/marcduiker/xebia-webinar-week-azurefunctions/tree/development-v3-start) | .NET Core 3 / Azure Functions 3 | No
