# How to use dependency injection in .NET Azure Functions 

This repository contains several branches which can be used to illustrate what needs to be refactored in order to use dependency injection in a .NET Core Azure Functions project.

This repository is used at a live webinar during [Xebia Webinar Week](https://pages.xebia.com/academy-webinar-week/dependency-injection-in-net-azure-functions).

This is the `development-v3` branch which contains a final refactored solution, based on .NET Core 3, which is using dependency injection.

|Branch name| Versions | Uses DI |
|-|-|-|
| development-v2-start | .NET Core 2 / Azure Functions 2 | No
| development-v2 | .NET Core 2 / Azure Functions 2 | Yes
| development-v3-start | .NET Core 3 / Azure Functions 3 | No
| development-v3 | .NET Core 3 / Azure Functions 3 | Yes
